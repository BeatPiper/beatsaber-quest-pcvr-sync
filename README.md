# beatsaber-quest-pcvr-sync

Sync your BeatSaber maps/playlists/favorites between the Quest and PCVR version of the game

## Motivation

I mainly created this for myself as I'm playing on both the Quest and PC.
I wanted to be able to sync my maps/playlists/favorites with a click of a button.

1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/D3SOX/beatsaber-quest-pcvr-sync.git`
2. Install dependencies  
   `pnpm install`
3. Start the app  
   `pnpm start`
4. Follow the instructions
